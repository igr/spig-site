# ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Development

**Spignite** runs in `DEVELOPMENT` mode by default. Some operations skip additional processing in development mode, like HTML minification.

### Building

Build the site with:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Live mode with reload

Development is faster in the live mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and all the changes will be automatically deployed to the living website, available on **http://localhost:3000**
