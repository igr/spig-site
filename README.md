## Welcome!

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Spignite**</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">is a lightweight static website generator built with Javascript; that uses existing, mature libraries.</mark> You can think of **Spignite** as a _generic file processor_ applied to a use case of building a website.

All this makes **Spignite** easy to use and extend (it's just Javascript after all) and - quite _fast_. Enough talking; let's dig in.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Spignite** comes with _reasonable_ defaults. However, don't expect it works magically - it's a big chance you will end up writing some JavaScript code here and there!
{% endhint %}

### Why?

* Pure JavaScript - no surprises, no awful templating, no custom engines... This is just a collection of existing, proven tools configured to work together.
* Easy to write extensions and your own operations in JavaScript.
* Everything is configurable.
* **Spignite** is just a _file-processing_ engine; at the end: define the input files and operations to be executed on them.
* Very fast.
* Developer friendly.
